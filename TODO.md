# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Add a UI for setting the value within the WP admin
* Detect the number of custom fields that could be listed and dynamically adjust to show them all
* ...and if excessively large, replace the meta key name field with a smarter input field (akin to select2)

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/list-more-custom-field-names/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/list-more-custom-field-names/) as an issue or PR).
